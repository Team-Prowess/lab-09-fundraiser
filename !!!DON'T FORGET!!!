from lab instructions:

Main data is array of orders. Each order has products array 
and customer object:
[
    {
        customer: {
            // customer data
        },
        products: [
            {
                name: <id>
                quantity: 2
            }
        ]
    }
]
Products are own data, look something like:
[
    {
        id: 'coconut',
        name: 'Coconut Cookies',
        description: 'Delicious thing to eat',
        price: 3.50,
        image: 'image.png'
    }
]
